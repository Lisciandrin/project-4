# Educational Project: SASS/SCSS Preprocessor, BEM, Cross-Browser Compatibility

## Repository Description
In this educational project, I focus on three important aspects of web development: SASS/SCSS preprocessor, BEM methodology, and cross-browser compatibility. I explore and apply the following concepts and techniques:

- **SASS/SCSS Preprocessor**: I learn and utilize the SASS/SCSS preprocessor to enhance the efficiency and maintainability of my CSS code. By leveraging features like variables, mixins, and nested rules, I streamline my stylesheet development process.

- **BEM Methodology**: I adopt the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for structuring and organizing my HTML and CSS code. This approach promotes reusability, modularity, and clarity in building scalable and maintainable web interfaces.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: I ensure that my web pages display and function correctly across different web browsers. I test and apply appropriate CSS and JavaScript techniques to handle browser inconsistencies and ensure a consistent user experience.

By incorporating SASS/SCSS, BEM, and cross-browser compatibility practices into my web development workflow, I enhance code efficiency, maintainability, and the overall quality of my projects.

Happy coding!
